              The obsession of founder Kilian Hennessy is to make perfume
              visible. But how does one make a fragrance visible? In the world
              of Kilian Hennessy, it’s not an abstract concept but a concrete
              obsession. He considers it his mission to translate fragrance’s
              inherent intangibility into desirable, cult objects we want to
              live with and share with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              And nothing is more visible than lips—for whispers, giggles,
              kisses and nibbles— “they make you fall in love with a woman.”
              KILIAN PARIS’s scented makeup range launched in 2019 with Le Rouge
              Parfum scented lipsticks: a wardrobe of iconic red, pink, and nude
              shades, also featured in liquid textures with Le Rouge Parfum
              Liquid Ultra Matte.
            </p>
            <p>
              “My goal is to offer strong shields of protection and weapons of
              seduction at once. A great scent and a great lipstick are the two
              strongest weapons of seduction a woman can have!”
            </p>
            <p>
              As with perfume, KILIAN PARIS puts makeup back on its pedestal,
              “Ultra luxe makeup should be the essential in the excessive.”
              Don’t be shy! Party with bold KILIAN PARIS looks.

          <p>
            Founded 15 years ago by Kilian Hennessy, KILIAN Paris now has over
            34 unisex fragrances across five olfactive families - all inspired
            by our founder’s olfactive memories and his passion for nightlife,
            extravagance and elegance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past years, KILIAN Paris has been filled with fragrances,
            scented makeup, objects of desire, creative collaborations, as well
            as crazy parties all around the world led by our founder Kilian
            Hennessy, embodying its festive and unconventional motto, “Don’t be
            shy."
          </p>
          <p>
            KILIAN Paris also represents 15 years of sustainability commitments
            through its refillable fragrance flacons, a founding concept that
            materializes our founder’s longstanding belief: “True luxury should
            last forever."

      <div class="clearfix-container clearfix">

            <h2>OBJECT OF DESIRE</h2>

          <p>
            Kilian Hennessy’s fragrances were to convey rich heritage and
            storytelling, and so were the heirloom-quality objects that protect
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Art Deco carafes hold KILIAN PARIS scents as the perfect bar
            centerpiece, invoking the brand’s penchant for the finer pleasures
            of the evening, recalling Cognac tasting rituals from Founder Kilian
            Hennessy’s family heritage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engraved travel sprays, accessories with a nearly talismanic tactile
            charm, are endlessly refillable. Glass vials can be quickly slipped
            inside and switched up to have one’s scent meet the mood, season or
            travel destination. Elegantly crafted lacquered clutches and
            coffrets make for eye-catching, boldly scented objets of art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each KILIAN PARIS fragrance comes with its own partner-in-crime
            accessory to uplift the tactile and visual experience of the
            perfume, and to express Kilian Hennessy’s fundamental belief that
            our signature scent is our protective armor against the outside
            world.
